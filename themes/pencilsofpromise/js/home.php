				<h3><strong>Schools4All 2012 Promotion</strong></h3>
<p> <strong>Official Rules</strong></p>
<p> <strong>NO PURCHASE NECESSARY</strong></p>
<p><strong>PROMOTION DESCRIPTION:</strong> The Schools4All 2012 Promotion (the “<strong>Promotion</strong>”) is a fundraising challenge that begins on or about November 30, 2012 at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time (“<strong>ET</strong>”) and ends on February 28, 2013 at 11:59 p.m. ET (the “<strong>Promotion Period</strong>”). The Promotion consists of nine (9) weekly drawings (the “<strong>Drawings</strong>”) to award eighteen (18) weekly prizes (each, a “<strong>Weekly Prize</strong>”) and a fundraising sweepstakes to award the “Grand Prize”, “First Prize”, “Second Prize”, “Third Prize” and “Mobile Prize” as more fully described below.  Weekly Prizes will be awarded at the end of each of the “Weekly Periods” as defined below. Participation in the Promotion does not constitute entry and/or participation in any other promotion, contest or sweepstakes. By participating in the Promotion, each participant unconditionally accepts and agrees to comply with and abide by these Official Rules and the decisions of Pencils of Promise, Inc., 37 West 28th Street, 3rd Floor, New York, NY 10001 (“<strong>Sponsor</strong>”), which shall be final and binding in all respects.</p>

            

<p><strong>ELIGIBILITY:</strong> Only legal residents of the United States who are thirteen (13) years of age or older are eligible to enter. Participants who are under the legal age of majority in their state or province of primary residence (a “<strong>minor</strong>”) must get their parent or legal guardian’s permission to participate in the Promotion.  Minor participants will be required to provide parental consent in a form satisfactory to the Sponsor before he or she can be declared a winner and any prize can be awarded.  Sponsor, Scooter Braun Projects, Bieber Time Touring, Justin Bieber, Scott “Scooter” Braun, Island Def Jam, RBMG Music Group, Schoolboy Records, Barnes & Noble, and each of their respective parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, distributors, retailers, sales representatives, advertising and promotion agencies and each of their respective officers, directors and employees (collectively, the “<strong>Promotion Entities</strong>”) and the immediate family members, and/or those living in the same household of each, are ineligible to enter the Promotion or win a prize.</p>

            

<p><strong>HOW IT WORKS:</strong> To enter the Promotion, visit the web site, <a href="http://www.schools4all.org" title="Schools4All" target="new">http://www.schools4all.org</a> (the “<strong>Website</strong>”) and complete the required information to create your fundraising page (“<strong>Fundraising Page</strong>”). Once you have created the Fundraising Page, you can begin collecting donations directly at the Fundraising Page.  All Fundraising Pages must be linked to a recognized school in the United States as more fully described at the Website.  If you are currently not enrolled in any of the recognized schools listed at the Website, you must select a school from the list to be associated with.  A school page will be created for each school selected that will accumulate the total amount donated on each Fundraising Page associated with that school (the “<strong>School Fundraising Page</strong>”). The following prizes are available through this Promotion:
<br /><br />
To be eligible for the Grand Prize, the School Fundraising Page must have a balance of at least $25.  For every $25 that the School Fundraising Page accumulates during the Promotion Period, it will receive one (1) entry into the Grand Prize drawing.  There is no limit to an eligible school’s potential number of entries in the Grand Prize drawing.  At the end of the Promotion Period, all eligible entries will be entered into a random draw sweepstakes to determine the Grand Prize winner.
<br /><br />
To be eligible for the Mobile Prize, from your wireless phone, text the word “FLY” or “FLIGHT” to the short code 877877  (the “<strong>Short Code</strong>”). Once enrolled, you must refer at least five (5) additional subscribers to be eligible for the Mobile Prize.  All eligible participants for this portion of the Promotion will be entered into a random draw sweepstakes to determine the Mobile Prize winner.
<br /><br />
You may receive several text messages in response, including a message confirming your entry, legal disclaimers and options to receive future promotional text messages from Sponsor. You may opt-out of receiving future messages at any time by sending the word “STOP” to 877877.  The text messaging method of entry is designed to work with most of the major wireless carriers in the United States, but Sponsor makes no guarantee that any particular wireless service provider will participate, and the mobile phone that is used must be capable of sending and receiving text messages.  Participants should check their phone’s features to see if they have that capability.  Wireless service providers may charge participants for each text message, including any error message, that is sent and received in connection with the Sweepstakes, based on the applicable wireless service pricing plan.  Participants should consult their wireless service provider’s pricing plan for details.  Proof of text messaging the Short Code is not considered proof of delivery to or receipt by Sponsor of such entry.  Entering by sending a text message will not improve your chance of winning.
<br /><br />
In the event of a dispute regarding the individual who actually submitted a text entry, the entry will be deemed submitted by the authorized account holder of the wireless account supplied at the time of entry.  The potential winner may be required to provide Sponsor with proof that he/she is the authorized account holder of the wireless account associated with the winning entry.  If a dispute cannot be resolved to Sponsor’s satisfaction, the affected entry will be deemed ineligible.  The Promotion Entities shall not be responsible for incorrect or inaccurate entry information caused by any of the equipment or programming associated with or utilized in the Sweepstakes or by any technical or human error which may occur in the processing of the entries in the Sweepstakes.  The Promotion Entities assume no responsibility or liability for any error, omission, interruption, deletion, theft or destruction, or unauthorized access to, or alteration of entries.
<br /><br />
At the end of each Weekly Period (as defined in the chart below), the School Fundraising Pages that accumulate the highest and second highest amounts of money during that given Weekly Period will be awarded a Weekly Prize.

At the end of the Promotion Period, the School Fundraising Pages that accumulate the highest, second highest and third highest amounts of money will be awarded the First, Second and Third Prize, respectively, subject to verification of eligibility and compliance with the terms of these Official Rules.
<br /> <br />
Additionally, Sponsor reserves the right to add additional methods of obtaining an entry into the Sweepstakes during the Promotion Period (each, a “<strong>Bonus Entry</strong>” and collectively, “<strong>Bonus Entries</strong>”).  Details on the Bonus Entry opportunities may appear on the Website or on Sponsor’s Twitter Feed. 
<br /><br />
All requested information to create a Fundraising Page must be completed at the Website to enter and to be eligible to win.  Incomplete entries will be disqualified.  Except as contemplated in these Official Rules, personal information collected in connection with this Promotion will be used in accordance with the privacy policy found on the Website. 
<br /><br />
In the event a dispute regarding the identity of the individual or school associated with a Fundraising Page cannot be resolved to Sponsor’s satisfaction, the affected entry will be deemed ineligible.  The Promotion Entities shall not be responsible for incorrect or inaccurate entry information whether caused by Internet users or by any of the equipment or programming associated with or utilized in the Promotion or by any technical or human error which may occur in the processing of the entries in the Promotion.  The Promotion Entities assume no responsibility or liability for any error, omission, interruption, deletion, theft or destruction, or unauthorized access to, or alteration of entries.   <strong>Limit one (1) Fundraising Page per person and/or per e-mail address.</strong></p>

<p><strong>WINNER SELECTION AND NOTIFICATION:</strong> At the end of the Promotion Period, the prize winners for the Grand Prize and Mobile Prize will be randomly selected from all eligible entries received during the Promotion Period.  
<br /><br />
At the end of each Weekly Period, the School Fundraising Pages that accumulate the highest and second highest amounts of money during that Weekly Period will each be awarded a Weekly Prize. <strong>All Weekly Prize winners are ineligible for subsequent Weekly Prizes.</strong> 
<br /><br />
At the end of the Promotion Period, the School Fundraising Page that accumulates the highest amount of money will be awarded the First Prize, the School Fundraising Page that accumulates the second highest amount of money will be awarded the Second Prize and the School Fundraising Page that accumulates the third highest amount of money will be awarded the Third Prize.   
<br /><br />
The potential prize winners will be notified by telephone and/or mail and/or e-mail, using contact information provided or collected at the time of entry. Sponsor shall have no liability for any winner notification that is lost, intercepted or not received by a potential winner for any reason.  If, despite reasonable efforts, a potential winner does not respond within seventy-two (72) hours of the first notification attempt, or if the prize or prize notification is returned as unclaimed or undeliverable to such potential winner, such potential winner will forfeit his or her prize and an alternate winner may be selected.  Sponsor, in its sole discretion, will attempt to contact up to three (3) potential winners of a prize in accordance with the above procedure, after which the prize in question may go unawarded if it remains unclaimed.  If any potential prize winner is found to be ineligible, or if he or she has not complied with these Official Rules or declines the prize for any reason prior to award, such potential prize winner will be disqualified and an alternate prize winner may be selected.  <strong>The odds of winning the Mobile Prize and the Grand Prize depend on the number of eligible entries received for each sweepstakes, respectively.</strong>

Sponsor reserves the right to structure the travel route and select hotels in its sole discretion.  In the event winner and/or his/her travel companion engages in behavior that (as determined by Sponsor in its sole and absolute discretion) is obnoxious or threatening, illegal or that is intended to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass any other person, Sponsor reserves the right to terminate the trip or other applicable experience early, in whole or in part, and send winner and/or his or her travel companion home with no further compensation.  <strong>Exact date of visit to be determined by Sponsor in conjunction with the availability of Mr. Bieber.</strong> Date of departure and return are subject to change at Sponsor's sole discretion.  In the event prize winners cannot travel on dates designated by Sponsor, prizes will be forfeited and an alternate winner will be selected. 
</p>

<p><strong>GENERAL PRIZE CONDITIONS:</strong> No cash alternative or prize substitutions will be allowed, except Sponsor reserves the right to substitute prize(s) of comparable value if a prize listed is unavailable for any reason.

<p><strong>GENERAL:</strong> Acceptance of a prize constitutes prize winner’s permission (and in the case of a minor, prize winner’s parent/legal guardian’s permission) for Sponsor to use prize winner’s name, photograph, likeness, voice, biographical information, statements and address (city and state) for advertising and/or publicity purposes worldwide and in all forms of media now known or hereafter developed, in perpetuity, without further compensation.  Participants (and, in the case of a minor, participants’ parent/legal guardian) agree that the Promotion Entities (A) shall not be responsible or liable for, and are hereby released from, any and all costs, injuries, losses or damages of any kind, including, without limitation, death and bodily injury, due in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, to participation in the Promotion or any Promotion-related activity, or from participants’ acceptance, receipt, possession and/or use or misuse of any prize, and (B) have not made any warranty, representation or guarantee express or implied, in fact or in law, with respect to any prize, including, without limitation, to such prize’s quality or fitness for a particular purpose.  Sponsor assumes no responsibility for any damage to a participant’s or any other person’s computer system or wireless phone which is occasioned by accessing the Website or otherwise participating in the Promotion, or for any computer system, phone line, hardware, software or program malfunctions, or other errors, failures, delayed computer transmissions or network connections that are human or technical in nature. Sponsor is not responsible for incomplete, illegible, misdirected, misprinted, late, lost, damaged, stolen, or postage-due submissions or prize notifications; or for lost, interrupted, inaccessible or unavailable networks, servers, satellites, Internet service providers, websites, or other connections; or for miscommunications, failed, jumbled, scrambled, delayed, or misdirected computer, telephone or cable transmissions; or for any technical malfunctions, failures, difficulties or other errors of any kind or nature; or for the incorrect or inaccurate capture of information, or the failure to capture any information.  Sponsor reserves the right in its sole discretion to disqualify any individual who is found to be tampering with the entry process or the operation of the Promotion or the Website, to be acting in violation of these Official Rules, or to be acting in an unsportsmanlike or disruptive manner, or with the intent to disrupt or undermine the legitimate operation of the Promotion, or to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass any other person, and Sponsor reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from any such person to the fullest extent permitted by law.  No mechanically reproduced, illegible, incomplete, forged, software-generated or other automated multiple entries will be accepted.

In the event Sponsor is prevented from awarding prizes or continuing with the Promotion as contemplated herein by any event beyond its control, Sponsor shall have the right to modify, suspend, or terminate the Promotion.  If the Promotion is terminated before the designated end date, Sponsor will (if possible) select Grand Prize and Mobile Prize winners in a random drawing from all eligible, non-suspect entries received as of the date of the event giving rise to the termination (in the manner described above) and will select the Weekly Prize, First Prize, Second Prize and Third Prize winners based on the Fundraising Pages that have raised the highest and second highest amounts of money, respectively, as of the date of the event giving rise to the termination (in the manner described above).  Inclusion in such drawing shall be each participant’s sole and exclusive remedy under such circumstances.  These Official Rules cannot be modified or amended in any way except in a written document issued by a duly authorized representative of Sponsor.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of these Official Rules shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision.  In the event that any provision is determined to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable or illegal, these Official Rules shall otherwise remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with their terms as if the invalid or illegal provision were not contained herein.</p>
